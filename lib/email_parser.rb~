# Build a class EmailParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').

  def initialize(str)
    @emails = str
  end

  def parse
	# regex manes split on space or comma
    @emails.split(/[\s,]+/).uniq
